#  Assignment-1 â€” Power Load Prediction  
*USEREADY*

This project is a classic classification task aimed at predicting the **load type on a power grid** â€” either **LIGHT**, **MEDIUM**, or **MAXIMUM LOAD** â€” based on historical energy usage and environmental data.

It covers the **end-to-end data science workflow**, from data preprocessing to feature engineering and model evaluation.

##  Project Objective

The goal was to build a machine learning model that classifies power grid load types using features like:

- Energy usage (KWh)
- Reactive power (lagging/leading)
- COâ‚‚ levels
- Time-based features (hour, day, month)

##  The Dataset

Filename: `LOAD_DATA.CSV`  
The dataset includes the following key columns:

| Column Name                               | Description                              |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `DATE_TIME`                               | Timestamp of the reading                 |
| `USAGE_KWH`                               | Energy usage in kilowatt-hours           |
| `LAGGING_CURRENT_REACTIVE_POWER_KVARH`    | Lagging reactive power                   |
| `LEADING_CURRENT_REACTIVE_POWER_KVARH`    | Leading reactive power                   |
| `CO2(PPM)`                                | COâ‚‚ levels in parts per million          |
| `NSM`                                     | Seconds from midnight                    |
| `LOAD_TYPE`                               | Target class: LIGHT / MEDIUM / MAXIMUM   |

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1.  Data Preprocessing

- Renamed inconsistent column headers
- Filled missing values:
  - **Numerical**: Median
  - **Categorical**: Mode

### 2.  Feature Engineering

From the `DATE_TIME` field, the following were extracted:

- `HOUR` â€” hour of the day
- `DAYOFWEEK` â€” day of the week (0 = Monday)
- `MONTH` â€” numeric month

### 3.  Train/Test Split

- Used the **last month** of the dataset as the **test set**
- Remaining data used for **training**

This time-based split simulates a real-world future prediction scenario.

### 4.  Model Training & Evaluation

Tested the following models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

Metrics used:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

This is the result and it tells us that Random Forest is the best among all three alogs used
